You will be given an array of employee records. You need to prepare the organisation tree using the array.

Each employee record will have 4 data points:
- ID (Unique ID of each employee)
- Name
- Image
- Reportees (List of IDs who report to this employee)

Sample structure:
CEO
  - Manager A
    - Employee X
       - Junior Employee Z
  - Manager B
    - Employee Y
